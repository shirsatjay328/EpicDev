These fences are typically installed around school perimeters, playgrounds, and outdoor facilities to prevent unauthorized access and protect children from potential hazards. Slat fences offer a combination of security and aesthetics, blending seamlessly into the school’s environment while providing a clear boundary. The demand for municipal slat fences in schools is growing as safety regulations become more stringent, and institutions aim to balance security with a positive atmosphere.</p><p>Moreover, schools increasingly prioritize the durability and low maintenance costs of their fencing systems.
