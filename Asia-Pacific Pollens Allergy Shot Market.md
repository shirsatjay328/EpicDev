With their well-established infrastructure, specialized medical staff, and advanced diagnostic tools, hospitals provide comprehensive care for individuals with severe allergic reactions or those requiring long-term immunotherapy. Pollen allergy shots administered in hospitals are typically part of a broader treatment plan that includes consultation with allergists, diagnostic tests, and ongoing monitoring of the patient’s progress. Hospitals are also the preferred setting for individuals with complicated health conditions or those who need immediate medical attention in case of adverse reactions to allergy shots.

Many allergy clinics specialize exclusively in allergen immunotherapy, ensuring that patients receive tailored care based on their specific sensitivities to pollen. The growing number of private allergy clinics across major cities in the region is contributing to the expansion of the market.
