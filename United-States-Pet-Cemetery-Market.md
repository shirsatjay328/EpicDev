Moreover, pet shops may serve as a gateway for customers looking for pet end-of-life services, directing them to partnering pet cemeteries for burial or cremation services. This growing awareness of the full life cycle of pet care positions pet shops as an important player in the market, even though they may not directly provide end-of-life services themselves.

Additionally, there is an increasing trend in environmentally conscious pet cemeteries that offer green burial options or biodegradable urns, tapping into a growing consumer demand for sustainable practices.
